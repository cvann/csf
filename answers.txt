Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

##Header information entered.

Problem 2:
test-small GC-content: 0.3
sample_1   GC-content: 0.43029262963
sample_2   GC-content: 0.451051333333	
Sample_3   GC-content: 0.646864112524
sample_4   GC-content: 0.347852341166
sample_5   GC-content: 0.263157894737
sample_6   GC-content: 0.491518518519

Problem 3:
From test-small.fastq
File "dna_analysis.py", line 40, in <module>
linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined
This also is the feedback printed in the sample files too.

The same error appears for gc_count, NameError: name 'gc_count' is not defined

Problem 4:
GC-content: 0.3
AT-content: 0.7



Collaboration:
TA-Hendrickson found an error in my script on problem four that prevented the correct percentage from loading properly.


Reflection:

This homework as interesting because of its subject matter (DNA) and the results. I understood the loops used here much better. I spent approximately 3 hours working on this homework, most of the time was due to the path for Python27 was missing from my enviornment in the windows setting. I also forgot to report that the workstation I was sitting at did load up. I checked the cables and restarted the machinge with no change in the system.
